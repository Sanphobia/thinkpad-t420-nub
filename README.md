3d printed nub for T420 (needs work)

Use openscad to export into an .stl file. I used a 0.4 mm nozzle on an ender 3 printer with PLA.
it doesn't work right now, but if you use pliers to cut ~2mm upwards on each side you can put it on; the t420 has arrows that grip to the original trackpoint, so I am looking into adapting the model to that.
